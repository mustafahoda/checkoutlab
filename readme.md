## Using the Checkout Lab Sandbox

You can use the Checkout Lab Sandbox instantly onlineâ€”no need to clone the repository or run a local server. Just visit [https://checkoutlab.dev](https://checkoutlab.dev) in your browser.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Open the Sandbox
- Go to [https://checkoutlab.dev](https://checkoutlab.dev).
- On the homepage, you'll see options such as **Demo**, **Sandbox**, and **Pre-built Use Cases**.
- Click on **Sandbox** to launch the interactive sandbox environment.

#### 2. Explore the Sandbox Interface
The sandbox is divided into several key sections:

- **Top Bar**: Contains navigation, quick links, and access to documentation or support.
- **Configuration Panel (Left Sidebar)**: Here you can select payment methods, adjust Adyen component settings, and modify environment variables. Tooltips and validation help guide your configuration.
- **Code Editor (Center)**: Write or edit JavaScript, CSS, and JSON for your payment integration. The editor provides real-time validation, linting, and formatting. Errors and warnings are shown inline.
- **Live Preview (Right Panel)**: Instantly see the results of your configuration and code changes. The preview updates in real time as you edit, allowing you to interact with the payment form or component.
- **Save & Share Controls**: At the top or bottom of the editor, you'll find options to save your configuration locally or generate a shareable URL. You can also export your setup as a JSON file.

#### 3. Building and Testing Your Integration
- **Select or Create a Configuration**: Start from a blank slate or load a template/pre-built use case.
- **Edit Code and Settings**: Use the code editor and configuration panel to customize your integration. All changes are reflected live in the preview.
- **Validate and Debug**: Watch for validation messages in the editor and preview. Use the reset button to revert to defaults if needed.
- **Save and Share**: Save your work by generating a unique URL to share your configuration with others.

#### 4. Troubleshooting & Help
- If you encounter issues, check for error messages in the editor or preview.
- Use the in-app documentation and tooltips for guidance.
- For further help, visit the [Adyen documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/) or reach out via the support links in the top bar.
